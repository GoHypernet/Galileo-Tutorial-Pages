# Web3 Infrastructure Hosting in Galileo

Galileo supports a variety of decentralized protocols for node hosting. 

## Algorand

The [Algorand](https://algorand.foundation/) Foundation is dedicated to fulfilling 
the global promise of blockchain technology by leveraging the Algorand protocol and 
open source software, which was initially designed by Silvio Micali and a team of 
leading scientists. With core beliefs in the establishment of an open, public and 
permissionless blockchain, the Algorand Foundation has a vision for an inclusive 
ecosystem that provides an opportunity for everyone to harness the potential of an 
equitable and truly borderless economy.
