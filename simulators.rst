Simulation Software in Galileo
===============================

Galileo supports a variety of simulation software.

ACEMD3
--------

`ACEMD Platform <https://www.acellera.com/products/molecular-dynamics-software-gpu-acemd/>`_
is a complete and fast solution package, designed to run and analyze your molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. It includes ACEMD, Parameterize and HTMD
packages. ACEMD is the MD engine that runs the simulation, Parameterize is a force
field parameterization tool for small molecules and HTMD is a Python package that
you can use to create systems, prepare them and, once ACEMD has finished simulating
those systems, analyze their trajectories.

HEC-RAS
-------

`HEC-RAS <https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/>`_ allows the user to perform
one-dimensional steady flow, one and two-dimensional unsteady flow calculations, sediment
transport/mobile bed computations, and water temperature/water quality modeling.

EPA-SWMM
--------

`EPA's Storm Water Management Model <https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm>`_
(SWMM) is used throughout the world for planning, analysis, and design related to
stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems. It can
be used to evaluate gray infrastructure stormwater control strategies, such as pipes
and storm drains, and is a useful tool for creating cost-effective green/gray
hybrid stormwater control solutions. SWMM was developed to help support local, state,
and national stormwater management objectives to reduce runoff through infiltration
and retention, and help to reduce discharges that cause impairment of waterbodies.

FLO-2D
------

The `FLO-2D <https://flo-2d.com/>` model was conceptualized in 1986 to predict mudflow
hydraulics. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) supported the initial
model development and first application to Telluride, Colorado in 1988. Over the past
30 years, FLO-2D has become the most widely used commercially available flood model.

Tuflow
------

`TUFLOW <https://www.tuflow.com/>`_ is a suite of advanced 1D/2D/3D computer simulation
software for flooding, urban drainage, coastal hydraulics, sediment transport, particle
tracking and water quality. With over 30 years of continuous development, TUFLOW is
internationally recognised as the industry leader for hydraulic modelling accuracy,
speed and workflow efficiency.
