# Tutorial: Running Python in Galileo

### Gettting started with Python in Galileo

To get started with Galileo, [log into your account](http://galileo.hypernetlabs.io/) using Firefox or Chrome and download our Python example file [from GitHub](https://github.com/GoHypernet/Galileo-examples/archive/jupyter.zip). The downloaded file consists of a .ipynb file and a .csv file.

### Let's take a look at our files

The jupyter_example.ipynb conducts some exploratory data analysis and visualizes the decision boundaries of various machine learning algorithms using the supplied iris.csv data set. It also demonstrates how to use data sets loaded from an online source or from a library.

### Understanding the user interface and creating a Mission

When you log into Galileo, the first thing youâ€™ll see is your Dashboard:

![View of the Galileo Dashboard](images/common/dashboard.png)

To run the Jupyter notebook, start by navigating to the Missions tab using the side menu. On the Missions tab, click the **Creat a custom mission** button.

Configure the mission by selecting the mission type. Choose **Python** and then select the version. This tutorial will use **Interactive (Jupyter)**.

Next, give the mission a name and assign it to a default station to use. This tutorial will use the **Linux** station. Click **Next**.

Set the default amount of computational resources for the mission. Choose the CPU resources, GPU resources, and memory resources. Click **Next**.

Create the mission environment by choosing a password to access the Jupyter session. You can install any dependencies either by selecting them from the drop-down menu of popular repositories or by entering the packages' names manually. There is also an option to add the VIM text editor to the session. Click **Next**.

Finally, select the Cargo Bay you will use for this Mission. You can choose from the default Hypernet storage or an external storage provider. Galileo works seemlessly with cloud storage platforms such as Dropbox and Storj. Find out more about using these platforms [here](https://galileo-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cargobays.html). Click **Submit**.

The Mission has now been created!

### Running a job and collecting results

You will now see the new Mission reflected in the Mission tab. Click **Update Mission** to add and edit the Mission's files.

Upload the .ipynb and .csv example files by clicking the **Upload File** button. You will see the files in the Mission interface.

It is possible to edit text files directly in the Mission tab by using the Mission text editor. Find out more about the editor by clicking [here to visit the Galileo forum](https://galileo-forum.hypernetlabs.io/t/mission-text-editor-walkthrough/68).

Now we are ready to run a job using the Mission. Click the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the Mission tab. You will see a "Mission run successfully!" message. At the bottom of the Mission tab, you can track the progress of the job.

![You can track the job's progress below](images/python/track_job.png)

Once the job's status is "Job In Progress", you are ready to open Jupyter. Click **Job In Progress** and then click the tunnel URL.

![Click on the tunnel URL](images/python/tunnel_url.png)

Enter the Mission password you set previously. Click **Log in**.

You are now using Jupyter in Galileo and you have immediate access to the files you uploaded as part of the Mission.

Once you have finished working in Jupyter, navigate back to the Mission tab and open the three-dot menu in the Jobs progress panel. Stop the job by clicking **Stop Job**.

![Stop the job](images/python/stop_job.png)

The job will shut down and collect the results. Once the job progress reads "Completed", you can download any files generated by the Jupyter job by opening the three-dot menu again and clicking **Download**.
