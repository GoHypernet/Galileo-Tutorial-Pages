Web3 Infrastructure Hosting in Galileo
======================================

Galileo supports a variety of decentralized protocols for node hosting. 

Algorand

permissionless blockchain, the Algorand Foundation has a vision for an inclusive 
ecosystem that provides an opportunity for everyone to harness the potential of an 
equitable and truly borderless economy.
