# Tutorial: Running EPA-SWMM in Galileo

### Gettting started with EPA-SWMM in Galileo

To get started with Galileo, [log into your account](http://galileo.hypernetlabs.io/) using Firefox or Chrome and download our SWMM example [from GitHub](https://github.com/GoHypernet/Galileo-examples/archive/EPA-SWMM.zip).

### Let's take a look at our files

EPA-SWMM is software that supports planning, analysis, and design related to stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems. The SWMM example in this tutorial is *Example 9, continuous simulation* and is available with many other SWMM examples [here](https://www.openswmm.org/SWMMExamples).

### Understanding the user interface and creating a Mission

When you log into Galileo, the first thing youâ€™ll see is your Dashboard:

To run the EPA-SWMM example, start by navigating to the Missions tab using the side menu. On the Missions tab, click the **Creat a custom mission** button.

Configure the mission by selecting the mission type. Choose **SWMM5**.

Next, give the mission a name and assign it to a default station to use. This tutorial will use the **Windows** station. Click **Next**.

Set the default amount of computational resources for the mission. Choose the CPU resources and memory resources. Click **Next**.

Create the mission environment by specifying the name of the SWMM file, ending in `.inp`. You must also select the SWMM version. This tutorial uses SWMM 5.1.014. Click **Next**.

Finally, select the Cargo Bay you will use for this Mission. You can choose from the default Hypernet storage or an external storage provider. Galileo works seemlessly with cloud storage platforms such as Dropbox and Storj. Find out more about using these platforms [here](https://galileo-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cargobays.html). Click **Submit**.

The Mission has now been created!

### Running a job and collecting results

You will now see the new Mission reflected in the Mission tab. Click **Update Mission** to add and edit the Mission's files.

Upload the example SWMM files by clicking the **Upload File** button. You will see the files in the Mission interface.

![The uploaded files are now visible](images/SWMM5/uploaded.png)

Now we are ready to run a job using the Mission. Click the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the Mission tab. You will see a "Mission run successfully!" message. At the bottom of the Mission tab, you can track the progress of the job.

![You can track the job's progress below](images/SWMM5/track_job.png)

Once the computation is complete, the job will shut down and collect the results. Once the job progress reads "Completed", you can download any files generated by the simulation by opening the three-dot menu again and clicking **Download**.
