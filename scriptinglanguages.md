# Common Scripting Languages

Galileo supports both batch and interative sessions for a variety of common scripting
language.

## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming
language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of
significant indentation.

## Julia

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming
language. While it is a general-purpose language and can be used to write any application,
many of its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science.

## R Language

[R](https://www.r-project.org) is a programming language and free software environment
for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical
Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing
statistical software and data analysis.

## Stata


[Stata](https://www.stata.com/) is a general-purpose statistical software package developed
by StataCorp for data manipulation, visualization, statistics, and automated reporting.
It is used by researchers in many fields, including economics, sociology, political science,
biomedicine, and epidemiology. StataCorp personnel pronounce Stata.

## Octave

[Octave](https://www.stata.com/) GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended
for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear
and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a 
language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented
language.
