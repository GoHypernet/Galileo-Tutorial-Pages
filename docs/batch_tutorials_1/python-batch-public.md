# Tutorial: Running Python in Galileo

### Gettting started with Python in Galileo

To get started with Galileo, [log into your account](http://galileo.hypernetlabs.io/) using Firefox or Chrome.

### Understanding the user interface and cloning a Mission

When you log into Galileo, the first thing youâ€™ll see is your Dashboard:

To run the Python example, start by navigating to the Missions tab using the side menu. Clone the Python Batch example Mission from the Explore Missions tab. Use the filter to search for the mission by name and click "Apply".

Once you have found the correct Mission, click "View Mission".

To clone the public Mission to your account, click the "Clone" button in the upper right corner of the interface. Choose between creating a public or private clone and also choose which Cargo Bay to use.

You will now see a cloned copy of the Mission in your Missions.

### Let's take a look at our files

The python_example.py script conducts a linear regression using data from the mtcars.csv file, makes two simple plots, and then runs a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulates tossing a die 10 million times and calculates the ratio of rolls that equal six.

### Running a job and collecting results

Now we are ready to run a job using the Mission. Click the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the Mission tab. You will see a "Mission run successfully!" message. At the bottom of the Mission tab, you can track the progress of the job.

Once the computation is completed, the job will shut down and collect the results. Once the job progress reads "Completed", you can download the results by opening the three-dot menu and clicking **Download**.

Let's take a look at the the output.log file first, which returns the results of the regression and simulation:

Next, if we look in the results folder, we can see the plot we created for the regression:
